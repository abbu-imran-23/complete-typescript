/**
 * ? What is Typescript ?
 * * TypeScript is a programming language that adds static type checking to JavaScript.

 * * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means:
 * * 1. All JavaScript features and syntax are available in TypeScript.
 * * 2. Every valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.
 *
 * * Additionally, the runtime behavior of TypeScript is identical to JavaScript,
 * * as TypeScript is transpiled into plain JavaScript for execution.
 * 
 * ? What is Static Type Checking ?
 * * Static Type Checking is defining the types for variables, function parameters, return values, etc. 
 * * Which helps catch errors during the compile time rather than at runtime.
 * * Example:
 * * const name = "Alice" - Javascript
 * * const name: string = "Alice" - Typecript
